## Project Overview
Customer churn, or lapse, is a significant concern for any business with a subscription model or loyalty program. In this project, we explore these issues through data analysis and machine learning.

## Data Description
The data used in this analysis is customer transaction data from a rewards program.

## Methodology
We followed a systematic approach for this analysis, including:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Model Optimization (for the Logistic Regression model)
6. Model Selection and Comparisons
7. Feature Importance Analysis

## Key Findings
The Random Forest model was the most accurate in predicting customer churn. Key features influencing churn were identified.

## Strategies to Reduce Churn
Based on the model's findings, several strategies were proposed to reduce customer churn:
- Encourage regular customer activity
- Expand point collection opportunities
- Reward long-term customers
- Promote point redemption
- Encourage higher spending

## Conclusion and Next Steps
The detailed Jupyter notebook in this repository provides an in-depth view of the analysis process.

## Business Presentation
For a comprehensive understanding of the analysis and the business context, please refer to the PowerPoint presentation included in the repository.
